This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Python when calculating averages: handling empty lists. The `bug.py` file shows the initial flawed code, while `bugSolution.py` presents a robust solution.  The core issue lies in how the code addresses potential division by zero when input list is empty.  The solution ensures the code is both correct and robust.
